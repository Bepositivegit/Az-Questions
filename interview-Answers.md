- What is Azure DevOps?
```
Answer: Azure DevOps is a cloud-based DevOps platform providing CI/CD pipelines, version control, testing, and deployment automation.
```

-  What are the core components of Azure DevOps?
```
Answer: Azure DevOps consists of five services:
- Azure Repos – Version control
- Azure Pipelines – CI/CD automation
- Azure Artifacts – Package management
- Azure Test Plans – Testing framework
- Azure Boards – Agile project tracking
```
## Azure Boards
Azure Boards is similar to project management tools like Jira.

- Common topics:
  - What is Agile?
  - What is Kanban?

> **Note:** I will add specific questions on Azure Boards later. You might be asked one or two questions.

## Azure Repos
Azure Repos is similar to GitHub.

**Common questions:**
- **How is Azure Repos different from GitHub or Bitbucket?**  
```
Answer: There is no functional difference all of there. Azure Repos is part of the Azure DevOps ecosystem. it is a __ git remote repository __ provider similar to __GitHub__.
```

- **What are the two types of version control supported in Azure Repos?**  
  *Answer:* Git and TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control – Centralized Version Control).  
  > *Note:* If asked whether you have experience with TFVC, it's okay to say no. It's not commonly used.

- **How do you clone a repository from Azure Repos?**  
  *Answer:* Two methods:  
    a. Username and password  
    b. SSH method

- How can you enforce branch policies in Azure Repos?  
```
  *Answer:*  
  Go to your Azure DevOps project → Repos → Branches.  
  Hover over your branch (e.g., `main`) → click the ellipsis (⋯) → Branch policies.  
  Configure policies like:
  - Minimum number of reviewers
  - Required build validation
  - Check for linked work items
  - Merge strategy
```

- How do you manage access and permissions for Azure Repos?
```
Answer:
* we can do with 3 ways
 1. Use Azure DevOps Security Groups
Azure DevOps has built-in security groups such as:
Project Administrators
Contributors
Readers
2. Set Repository-Level Permissions
You can grant permissions at the individual repository level.
Steps:
Go to Project Settings → Repositories.
Choose the repository.
Click Security.
Assign permissions to users or groups:
Read
Contribute
Branch creation/deletion
Force push
Tag creation
Manage permissions
Use "Deny" with caution—it overrides any "Allow".

3. Use Branch Policies for Fine-Grained Control
Set up branch policies to:
Require pull request reviewers
Enforce builds before merges
Limit who can push to protected branches (e.g., main or develop)
Steps:
Repos → Branches → Select a branch → Click Branch Policies

```

- What is a repository policy, and how do you apply one?
```
Answer:
A repository policy in Azure Repos is a rule that helps control how code is added or changed in a repository, especially on important branches like main or develop. These policies help keep the codebase safe, high quality, and well-reviewed.
*  Common Repository Policies:
Require pull request reviews before merging
Enforce successful builds before code is merged
Restrict who can push directly to a branch
Limit merge types (like squash, rebase, etc.)
```
what is Squash commit ?
Squash Commit merge combines all your branch's separate commits into a single commit when merging into the main branch, creating a cleaner project history.

- **How can you restrict force-pushes or direct commits to protected branches?**
- **What is the purpose of *pull request templates*?**

## Azure Pipelines

**Common questions:**
- I have code in GitHub, and I need CI/CD with Azure Pipelines. How can you do that?  
  *Answer:* Create a service connection to connect GitHub.  
  At the time of creating the pipeline, modify the Git remote repository to point to **GitHub**.

- What is an Azure Pipeline?
Answer:
Azure Pipelines is a CI/CD service that automates software build, test, and deployment.

- What is the difference between and Classic Pipelines?
  * Answer:*
  - Pipelines: Code-based, version-controlled.
  - Classic Pipelines: GUI-based, easier setup.

- How do you define a pipeline using ?
  * Answer:*
``` 
  trigger: 
    branches: 
     include: 
      - main
   stages: 
     - stage: 
        Build:
          jobs: 
            - job:BuildJob
              steps: 
                - script: 
```
- What are triggers in Azure Pipelines?
```
Answer:
Manual Trigger
Commit Trigger
Scheduled Trigger
Pipeline Trigger
Pull Request (PR) Trigger
```

- What is an Agent in Azure DevOps?
```
Answer:
An agent is a virtual machine (VM) that runs pipeline jobs.
Microsoft-hosted agents: Managed by Azure.
Self-hosted agents: Installed by users for custom configurations.
```

- How do you store secrets securely in Azure Pipelines?
```
Answer:
Use Azure Key Vault.
Use Pipeline Variables with "secret" option.
```


- What are Service Connections in Azure DevOps?
```
Answer:
Service Connections allow pipelines to securely connect to external services like Azure, AWS, or Kubernetes
```
- How do you restrict a pipeline to run on specific branches?
```
Answer: We have use keyword "exclude"
The below content is for reference.
`
trigger: 
  branches: 
    include: 
      - main
    exclude: 
      - feature/*
`
```

- What are Artifacts in Azure Pipelines?
```
Answer:
Artifacts are build outputs (binaries, packages, Docker images) stored and shared between pipeline stages.
```

- What is the basic structure of Azure DevOps YAML? 
``` 
Answer:
A pipeline starts with:  
trigger: Specifies the branches that will trigger the pipeline.  
pool: Specifies the agent OS to run the pipeline.  
variables: Defines pipeline-wide variables.  
stages: Logical groupings of jobs (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).  
jobs: Part of a **stage**. A collection of steps that run on the same agent.  
steps: Part of a **job**. Actual tasks or scripts that get executed.
```
- What is a Multi-Stage Pipeline?
```
Answer:
A multi-stage pipeline has separate stages for build, test, and deployment.
```

- How do you implement pipeline approvals in Azure DevOps?
```
Answer:
Use pre-deployment approvals in Environments.
```
- What is a Deployment Group?
```
Answer:
A Deployment Group is a collection of servers or VMs used for on-premises deployments.
```
- How do you monitor pipeline execution in Azure DevOps?
```
Answer:
Use Logs, Azure Monitor, and Application Insights.
```

-  How do you implement rollback in Azure Pipelines?
```
Answer:
Re-deploy the previous successful artifact.
```

- What is the difference between **parameter** and **variable** in Azure DevOps YAML? 
--- 
Answer: If we require variable types like **boolean**, **string**, **number**, or **object**, we declare them as **parameters**.  
- In the case of **variables**, the type is always treated as a **string**.  
- Parameter values are evaluated **before** the pipeline starts (at compile time), while variable values can be changed **during** pipeline execution (at runtime).
---
- How do you connect Azure Cloud from an Azure DevOps pipeline?
```
Answer: by creating __servie connection__ in azure devops
```

- What are the differences between Classic Pipelines and YAML Pipelines?
```
Answer: 
  -  Use Classic if you prefer a UI or are just starting with CI/CD in Azure DevOps.
  - Use YAML if you want pipelines as code, better maintainability, and CI/CD versioning within your repo.
```

- What is the difference between a build pipeline and a release pipeline?
```
Answwer: A build pipeline compiles and unit testing, static code anaysis, push artifact to artiact reposioty, while a release pipeline deploys the built code to environments.  
```

- What are the different types of **hosted agents** in Azure DevOps for CI/CD?
```
Answer: In azure DevOps we have two type of agent. 1. Microsoft hosted agent, 2. Self hosted agents.
   - Microsoft hosted agents: these are managed by Azure devops
   - Selfhosted agents: we need to add our __VM__'s to azure devops, to run the pipelines on those VM's
```

- How can you pass variables between pipeline stages?
```
  * Answer:* we can do with two ways
   - define variable in the pipeline, call it
   - atach __varibale group__ to the pipeline, __variable group__ contain the list of key and value pairs
``` 
- What is a pipeline artifact, and how do you use it?
```
 * Answer:* After build the applicaiton, we will store applicaiton artifact inside the pipeline and publishing to use at the deployment. That why we are calling as __pipeline artifact__.
```
- How do you implement conditional execution of steps or jobs?
* Answer:* by using __condition keyword__. The below are the list of conditions
  - succeeded(): Runs if the previous step or job succeeded.
  - failed(): Runs if the previous step or job failed.
  - always(): Runs regardless of whether previous steps or jobs succeeded or failed.
  - canceled(): Runs if the previous step or job was canceled.
  - eq(): Checks if two values are equal (e.g., eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')).
  - ne(): Checks if two values are not equal.
  - and(): Combines multiple conditions to run when all are true.
  - or(): Combines multiple conditions to run when any are true.

- How do you implement approval gates in a pipeline?
  * Answer:* Approval gates in a pipeline are implemented using the Environment resource in Azure DevOps, where manual or automated approvals are required before progressing to the next stage or job.

- How can you set up deployment to different environments (Dev, QA, Prod)?
  *Answer:* creating __multi-stage__ YAML pipelines with separate stages for each environment, and using environment-specific variables and __approval gates__ for controlled deployments.

- What are service connections, and how do you use them?  
  *Answer:* Service connections in Azure DevOps are secure connections to external services or resource like, AWS, Azure, etc
- In how many ways of **service connection** configurations?
  *Answer:* we can do multiple way, 
  - app regisation(automatioc)
  - app registation( manual)
  - mamnaged identity 
  - note: explanation about each identidy take 5 minutes. I will update more detail later.as of now we are skipping.

- How do you secure secrets and sensitive information in pipelines?
 * Answer:* we can do it two ways.
   - store azure keyvault. connect azure keyvault to the pipeline.
   - attach variable group the pipeline, in the varibale group, value of varibale save as __secret__ instead of __text__. by default mode is __text__.

- How can you integrate Azure Key Vault with Azure DevOps to fetch secrets?

**Answer:** You can integrate Azure Key Vault with Azure DevOps by connecting Azure Key Vault using the Azure DevOps Service Connection with **Azure Identity**.

### Azure Key Vault Access Types:
1. **Public**: The Key Vault is accessible publicly.
2. **Public Restricted to Some IP Addresses**: The Key Vault is publicly accessible, but access is restricted to specific IP addresses.
3. **Private**: The Key Vault is only accessible within a specific Virtual Network (VNet).

#### 1. **Public Access**:
- In the case of **public** access, Azure DevOps Pipelines can automatically connect to Azure Key Vault.

#### 2. **Public Restricted to Some IP Addresses**:
- For **public access with restrictions to specific IP addresses**, you need to add the Azure DevOps Pipeline agent's public IP to Azure Key Vault's access policy using Azure CLI. After that, the pipeline will be able to connect to Azure Key Vault.

#### 3. **Private Access**:
- If Azure Key Vault is **private**, and the Azure DevOps pipeline is running on a **Microsoft-hosted agent**, the pipeline cannot connect to Azure Key Vault.
- If the pipeline is running on a **self-hosted agent**, the Azure DevOps pipeline can connect to Azure Key Vault, provided that both the self-hosted agent's VM and the Azure Key Vault's private service connection belong to the same **VNet**.

- What scripting languages can be used in Azure Pipelines?
 * Answer:* we can use shell , powershell and python scripting. 
- How do you use templates to modularize your YAML pipeline?  
  * Answer:* You can modularize your YAML pipeline by using templates to define reusable pipeline components (like steps, jobs, or stages) in separate YAML files, and then referencing them in your main pipeline file with the - template: keyword

- How do you enforce pipeline policies or permissions for contributors?
 * Answers:* Pipeline policies or permissions for contributors can be enforced by configuring branch protection policies, required approvals, and security settings in Azure DevOps, which control who can trigger, modify, or approve pipeline runs


- Most Azure DevOps projects use **.NET applications**. What are the steps to build a .NET application?
 * Answer:* 
   - set dotnet version
   - dotnet restore
   - dontet build ( this case we have to two arguements 1. Debud, 2. release. release is used for prodcution.)
   - dotne test
   - dotnet test --> publishing code coverage
   - dotnet publish --> publish the dotnet applicaiton artifact

- How can we integrate **SonarQube** with Azure DevOps pipelines?
  * By azure devops service connection.
    - Note: interviwer may ask about detailed steps of how static code analysis push to sonarqube, he will ask details steps in the __YAML__ file.

- What tools do you use or know about for identifying **security vulnerabilities** in software? How do you integrate them with Azure DevOps?
  * Answer:* generally most of the project use __Vera code__ tool to find the applicaton code valunetaies, 
  - we connect to azure devops pipeline by azure devops service connection, becase any third party tool intergate to azure devops piepline by __service connection only__

- **Important:** Do you have experience with Azure AKS? How do you deploy an application to Azure AKS using Azure DevOps?  
  > *Note:* Interviewers expect detailed steps for this scenario.
  * Answer:* 

- If we have an application to deploy to Azure AKS and it requires **sensitive information** from Azure Key Vault, what are the detailed steps to configure this in Azure DevOps and Azure AKS?
  > *Note:* Interviewers expect detailed steps for this scenario. it is __main question in any interview__. I will detail more about it later. these are the basic steps
  
  - In the CI , build  the code, exexute unit testing, static code analysis with sonarqube, build the docker image , push to ___container registery__.
  - In the CD, verify Azure identity by service connection, Connect azure aks cluster , run the helm prefined task, to deploy the application.
  > *Note:* as I told earlier, each pin point of the pipeline asked by  interviewer. It will take time to precise answer. I will write precise it tomorrow. 
 

- For services like Azure Cloud, Azure App Service, Azure VM, and Azure AKS, it's good to remember detailed CI/CD steps.
 >* Note:* It is write, it need practical deploy. Then only anyone can anser

- What is the difference between **System-Managed Identity** and **User-Managed Identity** in Azure?  
  > *Note:*  it is azure cloud concept, Sometimes asked in Azure DevOps interviews.
  * Answer:* __System-Managed Identity__ is automatically created, managed, and tied to a single resource, while __User-Managed Identity__ is created by the user and can be shared across multiple resources.
  > *Note:* to understand more, person has to do one example of implemeting both.

- What is the difference between **serice endpoint** and **private endpoint** in Azure?  
  > *Note:*  it is azure cloud concept, Sometimes asked in Azure DevOps interviews.
  * Answer:* A Service Endpoint extends a VNet to Azure services over the public network with secured traffic, while a Private Endpoint provides a private IP address within your VNet to access Azure services entirely over the private network.

- How do you deploy an application to production only after manual approval?
  * Answer:* You deploy an application to production only after manual approval by configuring an Environment with __pre-deployment approvals in Azure Pipelines__.


- What is the purpose of **Environments** in Azure DevOps?
  * Answer:* The purpose of Environments in Azure DevOps is to define and manage target deployment stages (like Dev, QA, Prod) with features like approvals, checks, and resource tracking for controlled and secure deployments.

## Azure Artifacts

* Only a few questions are asked on Azure Artifacts in interviews.

- What is the purpose of Azure Artifacts?  
```
Answer: Azure Artifacts is used to manage and share packages such as NuGet, npm, Maven, and Python across teams.
```

- How can we clone dependencies from Azure Artifacts?
```  
Answer: By configuring the package manager (e.g., npm, NuGet) to use the Azure Artifacts feed URL.

## Azure Test Plans

Relevant mostly to QA engineers; fewer questions are asked in DevOps interviews.

- **What is Azure Test Plans, and where does it fit in the Azure DevOps ecosystem?**  
  *Answer:* Azure Test Plans is a service for managing and executing test cases, both manual and automated, as part of the Azure DevOps ecosystem.

- **What types of testing can you manage using Azure Test Plans?**  
  *Answer:* Manual testing, exploratory testing, and automated testing.

- **What are the key components of a test plan in Azure DevOps?**  
  *Answer:* Test plans, test suites, and test cases.

- **What is the difference between test plans, test suites, and test cases?**  
  *Answer:*  
  - Test Plan: A container for organizing test suites and test cases.  
  - Test Suite: A grouping of test cases based on specific criteria.  
  - Test Case: A single test scenario with steps and expected outcomes.

- **How do you create a manual test case in Azure Test Plans?**  
  *Answer:* By navigating to the Test Plans section in Azure DevOps, selecting a test suite, and adding a new test case with detailed steps and expected results.
